# Basic-Serialization

This application is a template used by students to create their own parsers in an OOP style (***For learning***). It also builds a very basic test which we expand using a mock system to show how testing and files work. Only present are:
  * simple (interface-ish) FileParser for general parsing (text)
  * JSONParser for json files

Students would then create the XML and CSV parsers using this example and other data.

The data notes explain the "schema" of the data.
